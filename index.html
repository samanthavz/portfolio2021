                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p> I am currently studying Communication and Multimedia design at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam. 
                    My hobby's consist out of drawing, creating creative products, designing, gaming and recently added to my list: coding. 
                    Since I started my studies at the HvA I have had a passion for coding and building websites. I am eager to learn a lot too, such as backend.
                    Right now I am focussing on improving my HTML/CSS and Javascript skills and looking for an internship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have experience in catering and teaching assistant work. I also have skills in adobe programs such as: Illustrator, Photoshop, Adobe XD and Premiere Pro. 
                    I'd like to see myself as an flexible person with many interests in the creative sector. I also often create drawings, traditional and digital.
                </p>
