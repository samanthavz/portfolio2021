                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p> I am a 3rd year in <b>Communication and Multimedia design</b> at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam (HvA). 
                    My hobbies are drawing, creating creative products, designing, gaming and coding. 
                    Since I started my studies at the HvA I have had a passion for programming and <b>building websites</b>. I am eager to learn a lot too, such as backend and <b>game development</b>.
                    Right now I am focussing on improving my JavaScript skills and learning C# in Unity.
                </p>

                    I have experience in catering and teaching assistant work. I also have skills in <b>adobe programs</b> such as: Illustrator, Photoshop, Adobe XD and Premiere Pro. 
                    I see myself as a flexible person with many interests in the creative sector. I also often create drawings, traditional and digital. You can check out a

                        <p>During this school project I had to copy an existing website and to recreate the underlying code myself. I chose the website <a class="textlink" href="https://www.sennep.com/" target="_blank">Sennep.com</a>, because I thought
                            it was a solid looking website and a good challenge for me. I did not have a lot of experience with JavaScript when I started making it, so I still had
                            a lot to learn. I am really proud of what I made, because it is my first responsive website. I scored full marks for this project.

                        <h3>My first Unity project</h3>
                        <p>I recently started making games in <a class="textlink" href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank">Unity</a>. I made a VR game called "bestiary" for a school course called Emerging Tech.
                         This was my first time using Unity so it is not a perfect prototype, but I learned a lot from it. I also did a lot of reflecting on
                        my work and progress. This project triggered my interested in game design/development a lot and I am eager to learn more about it. Everything I did is documented in the link below.</p>

                        <p>Minor Applied Game Design</p>
                        <h3>Building games in Unity</h3>
                        <p> As of late, I started following a Game design minor. I am really enjoying this so far and I have become very enthusiastic about everything surrounding the process of building games. I do not only enjoy the design part of it, but also asset creation and programming. 
                            You can find some of the games I have worked on my <a class="textlink" href="https://sam-vz.itch.io/" target="_blank">Itch.io</a> page. I want to highlight my game: <b>Nightmarish</b>, because I made this game entirely by myself, except for the audio.
                            I also got full marks on the documentation of this game. You can play it by <a class="textlink" href="https://sam-vz.itch.io/nightmarish" target="_blank">Clicking here</a>, or read the documentation through the link below.
