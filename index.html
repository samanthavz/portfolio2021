                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p> I am currently studying <b>Communication and Multimedia design</b> at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam. 
                    My hobbies consist out of drawing, creating creative products, designing, gaming and recently added to my list: coding. 
                    Since I started my studies at the HvA I have had a passion for coding and <b>building websites</b>. I am eager to learn a lot too, such as backend.
                    Right now I am focussing on improving my HTML/CSS and Javascript skills and looking for an <b>internship</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have experience in catering and teaching assistant work. I also have skills in <b>adobe programs</b> such as: Illustrator, Photoshop, Adobe XD and Premiere Pro. 
                    I'd like to see myself as an flexible person with many interests in the creative sector. I also often create drawings, traditional and digital.
                </p>

                        <p>During this project I had to copy an excisting website. I chose the website <a href="https://www.sennep.com/">Sennep.com</a>, because I thought
                            it was a solid looking website and a good challenge for me. I didn't had a lot of experience with JavaScript when I started making it, so I still had
                            a lot to learn. I am really proud OF what I made, because it is my first responsive website. I scored full marks for this project. </p>
